## Analysis

### Introduction

##### One of the most significant issues in Pereira is its economic growth 

For this project, information was extracted from TerriData, which provides data on geography and various economic indicators from 2010 to 2023. However, there is limited information available for the years 2021 to 2023, so a filter was applied."


### Summary of Results

1. There was an increase in the poverty rate from 29% to 41%, and extreme poverty rose from 3% to 10% during the COVID-19 period, specifically from 2019 to 2020.

2. Employment and income per capita showed consistent growth from 2010 to 2020.

3. The tertiary sector is the most significant income-generating activity in Pereira, accounting for 72.6% of economic activity.              

4. The data indicates that education, healthcare, and transportation have received the highest investments in Pereira.
